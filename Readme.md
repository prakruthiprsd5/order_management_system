Welcome to our online Order Management web application! 
This application allows customers to easily place orders while providing administrators with a 
user-friendly interface to manage inventory, view orders, and generate reports.



## We have utilized several technologies to create a seamless and efficient user experience. 
- Maven is used for dependency management
- Spring MVC for web application development, 
- Spring Data JPA for creating custom repositories, and 
- Spring Boot for autoconfiguration. 

- Additionally, Spring Security is utilized for authentication and authorization, 
- Hibernate Validator for form data validation, and 
- H2 In-memory Database for data storage. 
- The Java Mail API is used to send HTML E-Mail over SMTP.
